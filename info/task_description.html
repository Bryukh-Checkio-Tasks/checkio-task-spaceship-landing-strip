    <p> "Wow! That was a terrible landing!" Stephen was the first one to break the silence after the ship descended.</p>

    <p> "Who set up the landing vector?" asked Sofia as she emerged from a heap of cables and shook ashes off herself.
        "Who borks it that badly? I bet that was the Odysseus’s last landing ever!" </p>

    <p> "I’m doing a systems check right now." said Nikola. He was at the computer, typing away furiously with his
        famous <b>do not disturb me</b> look worn on his face. It seemed as though there were no computational errors.
    </p>

    <p> “Well we’ve got loads of opportunity for adventure here!” Sofia said, making the best of a bad situation.</p>

    <p> "I beg you--don’t tell me what a great opportunity it is. The trip has already started off in the best possible
        manner." Stephen responded tersely.</p>

    <p> "Fine..."</p>

    <p> "Geez, now I understand why expeditions to these lands happen so rarely…"</p>

    <p> "It won't take off," Nikola announced. Only he was able to shock the team so bluntly.</p>

    <p> "What? The cabin is fine! We’ll just fix the damage and continue on our journey," Sofia started hopefully.</p>

    <p> "It’s not going to work. The engine is pretty well fried. We don’t have all the necessary parts to fix it."</p>

    <p> "Awesome!” Stephen said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “So now we're stuck here for the rest of eternity
        until we all bluescreen in the cold."</p>

    <p> "Stephen, calm down," interrupted Sofia. "Is everything fine with the communications array? Can we call for
        help?"</p>

    <p> "It’s only working one way--we can only send data," Nikola started saying slowly as he tested something on the
        computer. "We can't receive any data, so the receiver must be broken. I'll set the transmitter to continuously
        send out a mayday signal."</p>

    <p> "Okay, let’s do that. Now, in order to be saved by the emergency team, we’ll need to clean up a landing site as
        much as possible." </p>

    <p> "I'm already scanning the area and making a map to calculate the best place for them to land," Nikola said
        agreeing to Sofia’s proposition.</p>

    <p> "Great! And I get to clear out the landing area, right?" said Stephen then paused. "Just in advance, I want to
        say that even though I am a handyman, I cannot move mountains or change the flow of rivers."</p>

    <p> "Okay, I suppose we should take that into consideration. Now let's write a calculation module."</p>

    <p> "Yeah, good idea. For now we can settle into this Rossum forsaken place." </p>

<p>The Robots have accidentally discovered a new island and want to create the largest rectangular field possible for a
    spaceship landing strip. While surveying their land, they encountered a number of obstacles and decided to draw a
    map. Indicate in each square of the map whether it contains grass (G), rock (R), water (W), shrubs (S), or trees
    (T). While the grass can be mowed and the shrubs can be dug from the ground, the water, rocks, and trees cannot be
    removed. Given these obstacles, determine the area of the largest possible rectangular field.</p>

<p><strong>Input:</strong> An array with lines. Each array should contain letter characters which indicate the
    conditions for each square of land (G, R, W, S, or T). The width of the map is indicated by the number of lines
    within an array. The height of the map is indicated by the number of items within a line within the array.</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The maximum area of the largest possible rectangle that can be cleared.</p>
